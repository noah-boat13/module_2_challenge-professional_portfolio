# Noah Kanagy's Professional Portfolio

## Description

This webpage is a personal portfolio built with the intention to give a short backgroud into who I am and my work/hobbies, along with a links to multiple projects I've built as well as different ways to contact me. It is a tool that I will continue to add to/refine as my coding class continues to progress and hopefully will be using to find employment after I recieve a certificate.

## Credits
I pair-programmed part of this project with my classmate Vic Swain and was able to help him troubleshoot some issues with his project as well.
